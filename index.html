                <h5>Personal Pronouns:</h5>
                <p>These are pronouns used to refer to people or things. We have pronouns like "I," "you," "he," "she," "it," "we," and "they." For example, "I love learning about technology."</p>

                <h5>Possessive Pronouns:</h5>
                <p>These show ownership. They include "my," "your," "his," "her," "its," "our," and "their." For instance, "This AI project is mine."</p>

                <h5>Demonstrative Pronouns:</h5>
                <p> These point to specific things. Common ones are "this," "that," "these," and "those." For example, "This smartphone is cutting-edge technology."</p>
            </div>

                <h5>Relative Pronouns:</h5>
                <p>These link clauses or phrases. You've probably heard of "who," "which," and "that." They help connect sentences like, "The AI that I built is revolutionary."</p>
            </div>

                <h5>Introgative Pronouns:</h5>
                <p> These are used in questions. They include "who," "what," "which," "whom," and "whose." For instance, "Who invented the internet?"</p>

                <h5>Reflexive Pronouns:</h5>
                <p> These end in "-self" or "-selves" and are used when the subject and object of a sentence are the same. Examples are "myself," "yourself," and "itself." For humor's sake, consider, "I tried to teach AI to make coffee, but it just brewed itself!"</p>

            <div class="p pright"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7milSsagCs?si=7n5_zMdiuwlCTlQN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

            <div class="p pleft">

                <h5>Reciprocal Pronouns:</h5>
                <p>  These indicate an action or feeling that is reciprocated. "Each other" and "one another" are common examples. Imagine two AI systems saying, "We help each other learn faster."</p>

                <h5>Indefinit Pronouns:</h5>
                <p>  These don't refer to a specific person or thing and include words like "everyone," "everything," "someone," and "nothing." Here's a motivational twist: "Anyone can learn AI, and everything starts with the first step."</p>

                <h5>Intensive Pronouns:</h5>
                <p> These are used to emphasize a preceding noun or pronoun. For a funny take, think of them as pronouns that say, "I did it myself!"</p>
            </div>
